# Travel Planner Domain Folder

## Workflow
1. Update `travel-planner-plan.md` before running `npm run domain`.
2. After implementation cycles, capture learnings or newly accepted scenarios in `travel-planner-spec.md`.
3. Keep AC IDs synchronised across plan, backlog, and QA outputs (prefix `TPA-`).

## Checklist
- [ ] MVP plan reviewed with stakeholders
- [ ] Spec sections populated post-implementation
- [ ] Backlog synced with `out/po` artifacts
